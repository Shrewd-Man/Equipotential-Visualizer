# Equipotential Simulator/Visualizer

## Description
I started this project to challenge myself and improve my C skills. The goal is to create a program that allows a user to visualize the interactions of electrostatic fields caused by point charges in space.

## Installation
Currently, this project does not have an installation option, as it is in its early stages of development. The code can be viewed in the `Equipotential-Visualizer/Equipotential-Visualizer/main.c` file.

To compile and run:
- Navigate to the project directory
- Replace `"./eqLinesRendered.png"` with desired file path for the rendered image
- Use `gcc main.c -o equipotential -lm` to compile (assuming you use math functions)
- Run `./equipotential`

## Usage
Please use in compliance with the GPL - 3.0 license. Details can be found in the file "Equipotential-Visualizer/LICENSE".

## Contributing
Contributions are more than encouraged. I'm always looking to improve my code and techniques so if you have any thoughts, submit a pull request!
